# Search Engine

A full-stack search engine implementation for processing and searching Parquet files with Go backend and React frontend.

## Architecture and Design Choices

### Backend Architecture

- **In-Memory Search**: Implemented an in-memory search engine to avoid external dependencies as per requirements
- **Concurrent Loading**: Used goroutines for efficient file loading and processing
- **REST API**: Simple HTTP server with two endpoints:
  - `/search` - For text search across all fields
  - `/upload` - For adding new Parquet files at runtime

### Frontend Architecture

- **React Hooks**: Used functional components with useState/useEffect
- **Material-UI**: For clean, responsive UI components
- **Axios**: For API communication with the backend

### Data Processing

- **Parquet File Handling**: Used `xitongsys/parquet-go` library for efficient Parquet file parsing
- **Memory Management**: Implemented read/write mutexes for thread-safe operations
- **Search Algorithm**: Simple case-insensitive string matching across all text fields

## How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+ (for backend)
- Node.js 16+ (for frontend)
- Yarn or npm

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
go mod download
go run main.go
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Environment Configuration

The application uses default ports:

- Backend: localhost:8080

- Frontend: localhost:3000

## Benchmarks and Performance Tuning

### Performance Strategies

1.  **Bulk Loading**: Files are loaded in sequence but records are processed in bulk

2.  **Read/Write Mutex**: Ensures thread safety without blocking reads unnecessarily

3.  **Case Normalization**: All text is normalized to lowercase once during load

4.  **Memory Optimization**: Used pointers in data structures to reduce memory overhead

### Potential Improvements

- Implement inverted index for faster searches

- Add field-specific indexing

- Implement result caching for repeated queries

## Stretch Goals and Enhancements

### Implemented Stretch Goals

✅ **File Upload Functionality**

- Users can upload new Parquet files after application startup

- Backend automatically reindexes all files including the new upload

### Notable Enhancements

1.  **Search Statistics**:

    - Track and display search time

    - Show total records and match count

2.  **UI Improvements**:

    - Loading indicators during search/upload

    - Clear error messaging

    - Responsive design for different screen sizes

3.  **Data Visualization**:

    - Formatted display of record metadata

    - Human-readable timestamps

4.  **Error Handling**:

    - Robust error handling for file processing

    - User feedback for invalid operations
